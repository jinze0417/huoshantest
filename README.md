1<br>
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720<br>
What if I told you that companies are literally waiting to hand you thousands of<br>
<br>
2<br>
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,480<br>
dollars for finding security issues in their assets?<br>
<br>
3<br>
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,280<br>
And I'm not talking about small chance here.<br>
<br>
4<br>
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,120<br>
We're talking about 10 to $15,000 per vulnerability.<br>
<br>
5<br>
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,240<br>
And listen, I have been in this whole bug bounty game for long enough to know<br>
<br>
6<br>
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,640<br>
that making $100,000 a year is completely doable.<br>
<br>
7<br>
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,720<br>
And to be honest, I'm not here to sell you on some get rich and quick scheme.<br>
<br>
8<br>
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,520<br>
I'm here to show you exactly the roadmap that I would personally take if I had<br>
<br>
9<br>
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,800<br>
to start with my first $100,000 all over again.<br>
<br>
10<br>
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,360<br>
And the thing with bug bounties is that every major company out there has a bug<br>
<br>
11<br>
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,480<br>
bounty program, take your meta, Google, Apple, TikTok.<br>
<br>
12<br>
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,560<br>
They all are willing to pay you serious money for finding these vulnerabilities.<br>
<br>
13<br>
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,520<br>
But here's a thing.<br>
<br>
14<br>
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,880<br>
In order for us to reach that 100k mark, we need to break it down into achievable<br>
<br>
15<br>
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,480<br>
milestones.<br>
<br>
16<br>
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,840<br>
First will aim for a thousand dollars, then make that 1000 to 10,000 and<br>
<br>
17<br>
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,640<br>
then eventually scale up to a hundred thousand dollars.<br>
<br>
18<br>
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,000<br>
But before we dive into the video, I'm thinking about creating an exclusive<br>
<br>
19<br>
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,400<br>
100k club on Discord where we can share tips, collaborate on findings and help<br>
<br>
20<br>
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,080<br>
each other and keep each other accountable in order to hit our six figure goal.<br>
<br>
21<br>
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,000<br>
So if you're interested, drop me a comment with 100k and I'll send you a link<br>
<br>
22<br>
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,520<br>
to join.<br>
<br>
23<br>
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,720<br>
Let's start off with just picking the right targets first because this is<br>
<br>
24<br>
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,960<br>
literally where most people tend to mess up.<br>
<br>
25<br>
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,760<br>
You need to find companies that need two critical criteria.<br>
<br>
26<br>
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,560<br>
One is a high payout and two having a massive attack surface.<br>
<br>
27<br>
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,200<br>
I'm going to break down the three examples of good programs to hack on, starting<br>
<br>
28<br>
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,760<br>
with Amazon, because for example, if you look at them, they're constantly pushing<br>
<br>
29<br>
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,760<br>
new code, sometimes multiple times a month.<br>
<br>
30<br>
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,200<br>
One day you look at Amazon.com and next day they have added a new feature for<br>
<br>
31<br>
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,640<br>
prime members or they have rolled out a new service.<br>
<br>
32<br>
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,720<br>
Each deployment is a new opportunity.<br>
<br>
33<br>
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,720<br>
Plus think about it.<br>
<br>
34<br>
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,920<br>
Amazon has hundreds of microservices.<br>
<br>
35<br>
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,960<br>
They have primed to have some central to have books that have authors.<br>
<br>
36<br>
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,040<br>
Those are all gold mines of potential vulnerabilities.<br>
<br>
37<br>
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,800<br>
FIS is another massive program to go after because they're handling financial<br>
<br>
38<br>
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,200<br>
transactions for banks all around the world.<br>
<br>
39<br>
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,000<br>
The complexity of their systems means when you find a vulnerability, it's usually<br>
<br>
40<br>
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,120<br>
a good one and not to mention their scope is massive.<br>
<br>
41<br>
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,120<br>
You can also look at programs like T Mobile, TikTok, Epic Games for similar<br>
<br>
42<br>
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,560<br>
reasons.<br>
<br>
43<br>
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,720<br>
These companies are constantly evolving, pushing new futures and maintaining huge<br>
<br>
44<br>
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,520<br>
attack surfaces that create the perfect opportunity for bug hunters.<br>
<br>
45<br>
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,240<br>
And here is something that most people don't know with these direct programs.<br>
<br>
46<br>
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,960<br>
They often have special invite only tiers if you're consistently providing value<br>
<br>
47<br>
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,160<br>
in sending them good bugs and communicating professionally.<br>
<br>
48<br>
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,960<br>
You may get invited to a private program or even a special live hacking event.<br>
<br>
49<br>
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,600<br>
Now here is something crucial.<br>
<br>
50<br>
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,920<br>
You need to understand about being successful with any program that you choose<br>
<br>
51<br>
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,760<br>
to focus on.<br>
<br>
52<br>
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,240<br>
And this also ties in with a colored tweet from moderator Justin that says,<br>
<br>
53<br>
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,280<br>
pick a target with lots of depth and a communicative team.<br>
<br>
54<br>
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,240<br>
Then become the world expert on it.<br>
<br>
55<br>
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,920<br>
This right here, this is the secret sauce.<br>
<br>
56<br>
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,480<br>
You need to understand two critical things about your target.<br>
<br>
57<br>
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,280<br>
First, their business model, what makes the money, what would hurt them the most?<br>
<br>
58<br>
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,960<br>
If you're hunting on meta, understand their ad system for Apple, know their ecosystem.<br>
<br>
59<br>
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,120<br>
For Amazon, learn their seller networks.<br>
<br>
60<br>
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,040<br>
When you understand what's sensitive to them, you'll know exactly where to look<br>
<br>
61<br>
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,640<br>
for for high impact bugs.<br>
<br>
62<br>
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,600<br>
Second, their tech stock, what frameworks do they use?<br>
<br>
63<br>
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,240<br>
How do they handle authentication?<br>
<br>
64<br>
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,840<br>
What's the deployment process like?<br>
<br>
65<br>
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,920<br>
The deeper you go, the more likely you are to find bugs that others miss.<br>
<br>
66<br>
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,200<br>
And here's something that sets top hundreds apart.<br>
<br>
67<br>
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,600<br>
They don't just understand the current system.<br>
<br>
68<br>
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,520<br>
They follow every CVE and end date that comes out of their targets.<br>
<br>
69<br>
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,120<br>
Tech stock.<br>
<br>
70<br>
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,120<br>
When a new vulnerability drops in a framework your target uses, you should be<br>
<br>
71<br>
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,320<br>
the first one testing if they're affected.<br>
<br>
72<br>
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,080<br>
This is how you turn knowledge into real money.<br>
<br>
73<br>
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,960<br>
But don't just chase CVEs blindly, follow the right people, read the right<br>
<br>
74<br>
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,160<br>
content and when someone drops it right up about your target, don't just read<br>
<br>
75<br>
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,960<br>
it, understand it deeply.<br>
<br>
76<br>
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,840<br>
Ask yourself, what other futures might have the same issue.<br>
<br>
77<br>
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,240<br>
That's how you turn one bug into many.<br>
<br>
78<br>
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,280<br>
Now, before we dive into specific vulnerabilities, let's talk about picking your<br>
<br>
79<br>
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,600<br>
niche.<br>
<br>
80<br>
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,160<br>
This is where most bug hunters get it wrong.<br>
<br>
81<br>
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,840<br>
They try to learn everything at once and end up mastering nothing.<br>
<br>
82<br>
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,720<br>
Here's what works.<br>
<br>
83<br>
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,880<br>
Focus on web and mobile security.<br>
<br>
84<br>
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000<br>
That's where the money is.<br>
<br>
85<br>
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,840<br>
And that's where most programs are.<br>
<br>
86<br>
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,880<br>
But don't just scatter your efforts across every platform, pick one major target<br>
<br>
87<br>
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,560<br>
and become the expert on that specific program.<br>
<br>
88<br>
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,240<br>
Think about it.<br>
<br>
89<br>
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,480<br>
Security is massive.<br>
<br>
90<br>
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,600<br>
We've got Web3 client side, server side, mobile desktop, but you don't need to<br>
<br>
91<br>
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,640<br>
master all of it.<br>
<br>
92<br>
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,120<br>
Pick one area and go deep.<br>
<br>
93<br>
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,400<br>
I mean, really deep.<br>
<br>
94<br>
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,920<br>
Learn the tech stack inside and out, understand their business model, build a<br>
<br>
95<br>
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,480<br>
collection of relevant bug reports, join this for communities that focus on<br>
<br>
96<br>
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,120<br>
your niche and follow the right researchers, reading other bug bounty hunters,<br>
<br>
97<br>
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,720<br>
the methodology and bug writeups is an optional.<br>
<br>
98<br>
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,800<br>
It's part of the job set time aside each week to study.<br>
<br>
99<br>
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,200<br>
Look at how other successful hunters approach your target.<br>
<br>
100<br>
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,360<br>
What techniques do they use?<br>
<br>
101<br>
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,680<br>
What patterns do you notice?<br>
<br>
102<br>
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,200<br>
This isn't about copying.<br>
<br>
103<br>
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,840<br>
It's just about building on what works.<br>
<br>
104<br>
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,000<br>
And don't get caught up trying to perfect your automation or tools.<br>
<br>
105<br>
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,920<br>
Learn just enough to be effective.<br>
<br>
106<br>
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,840<br>
Then spend time on actually hunting.<br>
<br>
107<br>
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,200<br>
The real progress happens when you're actively testing, not when you're<br>
<br>
108<br>
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,600<br>
tweaking your tools for the hundreds of time.<br>
<br>
109<br>
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,600<br>
Here's a strategy that actually works.<br>
<br>
110<br>
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,040<br>
Look for companies that run live.<br>
<br>
111<br>
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,840<br>
I can convince pick one become active on their program and make yourself<br>
<br>
112<br>
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,080<br>
known by building enough reputation.<br>
<br>
113<br>
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,800<br>
And you might even get invited to an exclusive event where the real money is.<br>
<br>
114<br>
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,200<br>
That's actually a tip that came from a treat from Douglas Day, AKA Archangel.<br>
<br>
115<br>
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,720<br>
I want to know, hey, how do you make 100 K and this was as<br>
<br>
116<br>
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,360<br>
responsive?<br>
<br>
117<br>
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,080<br>
I couldn't agree anymore.<br>
<br>
118<br>
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,160<br>
If you're still not ready and you need to master a specific vulnerability<br>
<br>
119<br>
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,720<br>
is before you decide on a niche, let me break down some vulnerability types<br>
<br>
120<br>
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,800<br>
that I personally think you should focus on that consistently lead to high<br>
<br>
121<br>
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,680<br>
impact finding.<br>
<br>
122<br>
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,280<br>
Let's start off with my favorite success, but not your basic alert<br>
<br>
123<br>
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,040<br>
success.<br>
<br>
124<br>
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,280<br>
I'm talking about chaining success with other functionalities or even<br>
<br>
125<br>
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,200<br>
open redirects to perform things like account takeovers.<br>
<br>
126<br>
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,240<br>
When you show a company how their accesses can lead to mass account compromise,<br>
<br>
127<br>
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,360<br>
then that's when those 10 K bounties start rolling in.<br>
<br>
128<br>
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,200<br>
But let me tell you something even better.<br>
<br>
129<br>
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,800<br>
Blind accesses, these are absolute gold because they often hit internal admin<br>
<br>
130<br>
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,400<br>
panels and support dashboards.<br>
<br>
131<br>
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,600<br>
Think about it when a support agent views a ticket or an admin reviews a profile,<br>
<br>
132<br>
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,240<br>
your payload executes with their privileges.<br>
<br>
133<br>
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,640<br>
I've seen blind accesses findings that pay more than most critical vulnerabilities<br>
<br>
134<br>
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,680<br>
because companies take internal compromise very seriously.<br>
<br>
135<br>
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,320<br>
So drop your accesses payload everywhere like a user profile for submissions,<br>
<br>
136<br>
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,040<br>
your user agent or even in error messages.<br>
<br>
137<br>
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,160<br>
The beautiful thing is that it might hit a few weeks or months later when someone<br>
<br>
138<br>
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,360<br>
internally finally reviews that data.<br>
<br>
139<br>
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,920<br>
And even if you get ahead, you're often looking at a security vulnerability<br>
<br>
140<br>
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,480<br>
that is going to give you access to internal systems.<br>
<br>
141<br>
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,000<br>
That's the kind of finding that can easily push you closer to that 100 K goal.<br>
<br>
142<br>
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,720<br>
That was an example of a client type vulnerability, but now we need to talk about a<br>
<br>
143<br>
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,680<br>
server cycle, not really like SSRF.<br>
<br>
144<br>
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,080<br>
SSRF is such a fun vulnerability, especially in cloud environments.<br>
<br>
145<br>
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,600<br>
Companies are pushing everything to AWS Azure and GCP.<br>
<br>
146<br>
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,680<br>
And when you can demonstrate how your SSRF can access internal services or<br>
<br>
147<br>
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,440<br>
a metadata endpoint, you are looking at a massive payday.<br>
<br>
148<br>
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,520<br>
But here's what most hunters don't think about.<br>
<br>
149<br>
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,440<br>
SSRF goes beyond just hitting the cloud metadata endpoints.<br>
<br>
150<br>
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,560<br>
Modern companies are running complex internal infrastructures.<br>
<br>
151<br>
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,760<br>
Think about your Kubernetes clusters, Kafka message cues internal APIs and even<br>
<br>
152<br>
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,840<br>
the monitoring systems.<br>
<br>
153<br>
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,680<br>
If you can pivot your SSRF to reach these services, then you're looking at a<br>
<br>
154<br>
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,960<br>
potential infrastructure while impact.<br>
<br>
155<br>
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,800<br>
These kinds of findings show real business impact because you're proving access<br>
<br>
156<br>
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,240<br>
to their entire backend infrastructure.<br>
<br>
157<br>
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,400<br>
The key here is to understand what modern companies are running internally.<br>
<br>
158<br>
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,480<br>
Learn about the common internal services, the default ports, the typical<br>
<br>
159<br>
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,400<br>
infrastructure setups.<br>
<br>
160<br>
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,560<br>
And when you find SSRF, don't stop at the first internal service that you<br>
<br>
161<br>
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:44,840<br>
hit.<br>
<br>
162<br>
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,960<br>
Think about what else might be accessible from there.<br>
<br>
163<br>
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,280<br>
Authorization issues are also where there is a ton of money to be made,<br>
<br>
164<br>
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,200<br>
especially for SaaS platforms.<br>
<br>
165<br>
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,960<br>
But here is what most hunters miss.<br>
<br>
166<br>
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,600<br>
Don't just look for basic items.<br>
<br>
167<br>
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,480<br>
Think bigger.<br>
<br>
168<br>
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,800<br>
Think about leaking sensitive information through the API endpoints.<br>
<br>
169<br>
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,640<br>
Can you access admin functionalities?<br>
<br>
170<br>
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,280<br>
Can you view other users data?<br>
<br>
171<br>
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,360<br>
That's what the companies are about.<br>
<br>
172<br>
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,280<br>
And that's what they care for.<br>
<br>
173<br>
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,160<br>
Here's a pro tip when you find these issues, always test them on off.<br>
<br>
174<br>
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,680<br>
By the night or within this, try it and see if we can access them without being<br>
<br>
175<br>
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,160<br>
logged in.<br>
<br>
176<br>
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,120<br>
If you find some admin functionality working for a regular user, then test<br>
<br>
177<br>
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,680<br>
out without being logged in and see if it can get access to it.<br>
<br>
178<br>
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,200<br>
Because testing for things like this, take a simple functionality from an<br>
<br>
179<br>
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,880<br>
admin that may not have an impact into a massive pative because you<br>
<br>
180<br>
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,000<br>
were able to prove multiple vulnerabilities within a single functionality.<br>
<br>
181<br>
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,680<br>
This actually leads me to one of the most overlooked aspects of bug hunting,<br>
<br>
182<br>
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,720<br>
which is proper API testing, but that comes with learning how to fuzz them properly.<br>
<br>
183<br>
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,080<br>
Most hunters just spray random parameters, but smart fuzzing is about<br>
<br>
184<br>
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,960<br>
understanding the API infrastructure and finding patterns.<br>
<br>
185<br>
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,040<br>
When you find one vulnerability, look for it across all of the API<br>
<br>
186<br>
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,400<br>
and points, one of my favorite things to actually look for is four or three<br>
<br>
187<br>
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,320<br>
bypasses and the patterns that come with it.<br>
<br>
188<br>
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,440<br>
Most people that see a four or three, they move on.<br>
<br>
189<br>
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,160<br>
But if you can bypass it and show how it leads to a massive data league, that<br>
<br>
190<br>
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,520<br>
is an easy critical finding.<br>
<br>
191<br>
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,920<br>
And then you can take that pattern and apply it across all of the different<br>
<br>
192<br>
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,400<br>
applications that the company owns.<br>
<br>
193<br>
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,840<br>
And don't sleep on patch reversals, especially when dealing with reverse<br>
<br>
194<br>
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,880<br>
proxies, modern applications are complex and the complexity creates one<br>
<br>
195<br>
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,440<br>
that abilities, one executed patch reversal can actually expose an entire<br>
<br>
196<br>
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,000<br>
internal network and tooling.<br>
<br>
197<br>
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,880<br>
So keep that in mind, even better, if you learn how to use patch<br>
<br>
198<br>
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,120<br>
reversals when it comes down to client side vulnerabilities, which is a whole<br>
<br>
199<br>
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,840<br>
different topic that I got to give a shout out to Justin, aka Ryan and<br>
<br>
200<br>
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,640<br>
writer and their podcast.<br>
<br>
201<br>
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,000<br>
Before we wrap up, I want to just talk about something that most people<br>
<br>
202<br>
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,360<br>
overlook on their journey to making their first 100,000.<br>
<br>
203<br>
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360<br>
And that's that every single dollar count.<br>
<br>
204<br>
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,320<br>
Listen, everyone dreams about landing that massive critical bug.<br>
<br>
205<br>
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,760<br>
The reality is that consistent medium findings can also add up and it helps<br>
<br>
206<br>
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,640<br>
build momentum.<br>
<br>
207<br>
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,960<br>
Don't get caught up and only hunting for criticals.<br>
<br>
208<br>
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,680<br>
If you can demonstrate real impact, reported those $500 and $1,000<br>
<br>
209<br>
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,120<br>
bounties, they stack up some of my most successful months come from multiple<br>
<br>
210<br>
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,200<br>
medium and high findings, rather than just one big hit.<br>
<br>
211<br>
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,120<br>
But here's the thing about reports.<br>
<br>
212<br>
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,720<br>
I love how Stoke explained this.<br>
<br>
213<br>
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,680<br>
They are your personal brand in debug bounty world.<br>
<br>
214<br>
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,800<br>
Think of each report as your shops window.<br>
<br>
215<br>
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,280<br>
You never know who's reading it or who they are connected to.<br>
<br>
216<br>
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,000<br>
I've seen hunters get private invites just because the reports were consistently<br>
<br>
217<br>
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,720<br>
professional and well run and learn to communicate impact clearly.<br>
<br>
218<br>
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,360<br>
Whatever you're using.<br>
<br>
219<br>
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,960<br>
See the assessor or not, make your point easy to understand.<br>
<br>
220<br>
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,320<br>
And if a charger doesn't accept the impact right away, don't get frustrated or<br>
<br>
221<br>
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,200<br>
just argue with them.<br>
<br>
222<br>
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,680<br>
Work on explaining it better.<br>
<br>
223<br>
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,560<br>
Sometimes a well explained medium bug can get escalated just because you<br>
<br>
224<br>
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,360<br>
communicated the impact clearly.<br>
<br>
225<br>
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,760<br>
And if a report gets undervalued and they get paid differently than<br>
<br>
226<br>
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,600<br>
you expected, don't let it get to you.<br>
<br>
227<br>
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,480<br>
State professional bug bounty is a long game.<br>
<br>
228<br>
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,080<br>
And your reputation is worth more than a single bounty.<br>
<br>
229<br>
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,800<br>
I have personally seen way too many bug bounty hunters burn bridges over a<br>
<br>
230<br>
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,120<br>
single downgraded report.<br>
<br>
231<br>
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,160<br>
And trust me, that's not how you get to $100,000.<br>
<br>
232<br>
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:55,680<br>
All right.<br>
<br>
233<br>
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,280<br>
What do you think?<br>
<br>
234<br>
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,680<br>
Are you ready to join the 100k club?<br>
<br>
235<br>
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840<br>
Let me know down below.<br>
<br>
236<br>
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,840<br>
And I will see you all in next week's video.<br>
<br>
237<br>
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,600<br>
Peace.<br>
<br>
