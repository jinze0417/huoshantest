##### 1
##### 00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
##### What if I told you that companies are literally waiting to hand you thousands of
##### 
##### 2
##### 00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,480
##### dollars for finding security issues in their assets?
##### 
##### 3
##### 00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,280
##### And I'm not talking about small chance here.
##### 
##### 4
##### 00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,120
##### We're talking about 10 to $15,000 per vulnerability.
##### 
##### 5
##### 00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,240
##### And listen, I have been in this whole bug bounty game for long enough to know
##### 
##### 6
##### 00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,640
##### that making $100,000 a year is completely doable.
##### 
##### 7
##### 00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,720
##### And to be honest, I'm not here to sell you on some get rich and quick scheme.
##### 
##### 8
##### 00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,520
##### I'm here to show you exactly the roadmap that I would personally take if I had
##### 
##### 9
##### 00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,800
##### to start with my first $100,000 all over again.
##### 
##### 10
##### 00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,360
##### And the thing with bug bounties is that every major company out there has a bug
##### 
##### 11
##### 00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,480
##### bounty program, take your meta, Google, Apple, TikTok.
##### 
##### 12
##### 00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,560
##### They all are willing to pay you serious money for finding these vulnerabilities.
##### 
##### 13
##### 00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,520
##### But here's a thing.
##### 
##### 14
##### 00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,880
##### In order for us to reach that 100k mark, we need to break it down into achievable
##### 
##### 15
##### 00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,480
##### milestones.
##### 
##### 16
##### 00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,840
##### First will aim for a thousand dollars, then make that 1000 to 10,000 and
##### 
##### 17
##### 00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,640
##### then eventually scale up to a hundred thousand dollars.
##### 
##### 18
##### 00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,000
##### But before we dive into the video, I'm thinking about creating an exclusive
##### 
##### 19
##### 00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,400
##### 100k club on Discord where we can share tips, collaborate on findings and help
##### 
##### 20
##### 00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,080
##### each other and keep each other accountable in order to hit our six figure goal.
##### 
##### 21
##### 00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,000
##### So if you're interested, drop me a comment with 100k and I'll send you a link
##### 
##### 22
##### 00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,520
##### to join.
##### 
##### 23
##### 00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,720
##### Let's start off with just picking the right targets first because this is
##### 
##### 24
##### 00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,960
##### literally where most people tend to mess up.
##### 
##### 25
##### 00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,760
##### You need to find companies that need two critical criteria.
##### 
##### 26
##### 00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,560
##### One is a high payout and two having a massive attack surface.
##### 
##### 27
##### 00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,200
##### I'm going to break down the three examples of good programs to hack on, starting
##### 
##### 28
##### 00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,760
##### with Amazon, because for example, if you look at them, they're constantly pushing
##### 
##### 29
##### 00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,760
##### new code, sometimes multiple times a month.
##### 
##### 30
##### 00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,200
##### One day you look at Amazon.com and next day they have added a new feature for
##### 
##### 31
##### 00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,640
##### prime members or they have rolled out a new service.
##### 
##### 32
##### 00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,720
##### Each deployment is a new opportunity.
##### 
##### 33
##### 00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,720
##### Plus think about it.
##### 
##### 34
##### 00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,920
##### Amazon has hundreds of microservices.
##### 
##### 35
##### 00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,960
##### They have primed to have some central to have books that have authors.
##### 
##### 36
##### 00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,040
##### Those are all gold mines of potential vulnerabilities.
##### 
##### 37
##### 00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,800
##### FIS is another massive program to go after because they're handling financial
##### 
##### 38
##### 00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,200
##### transactions for banks all around the world.
##### 
##### 39
##### 00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,000
##### The complexity of their systems means when you find a vulnerability, it's usually
##### 
##### 40
##### 00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,120
##### a good one and not to mention their scope is massive.
##### 
##### 41
##### 00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,120
##### You can also look at programs like T Mobile, TikTok, Epic Games for similar
##### 
##### 42
##### 00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,560
##### reasons.
##### 
##### 43
##### 00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,720
##### These companies are constantly evolving, pushing new futures and maintaining huge
##### 
##### 44
##### 00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,520
##### attack surfaces that create the perfect opportunity for bug hunters.
##### 
##### 45
##### 00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,240
##### And here is something that most people don't know with these direct programs.
##### 
##### 46
##### 00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,960
##### They often have special invite only tiers if you're consistently providing value
##### 
##### 47
##### 00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,160
##### in sending them good bugs and communicating professionally.
##### 
##### 48
##### 00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,960
##### You may get invited to a private program or even a special live hacking event.
##### 
##### 49
##### 00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,600
##### Now here is something crucial.
##### 
##### 50
##### 00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,920
##### You need to understand about being successful with any program that you choose
##### 
##### 51
##### 00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,760
##### to focus on.
##### 
##### 52
##### 00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,240
##### And this also ties in with a colored tweet from moderator Justin that says,
##### 
##### 53
##### 00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,280
##### pick a target with lots of depth and a communicative team.
##### 
##### 54
##### 00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,240
##### Then become the world expert on it.
##### 
##### 55
##### 00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,920
##### This right here, this is the secret sauce.
##### 
##### 56
##### 00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,480
##### You need to understand two critical things about your target.
##### 
##### 57
##### 00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,280
##### First, their business model, what makes the money, what would hurt them the most?
##### 
##### 58
##### 00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,960
##### If you're hunting on meta, understand their ad system for Apple, know their ecosystem.
##### 
##### 59
##### 00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,120
##### For Amazon, learn their seller networks.
##### 
##### 60
##### 00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,040
##### When you understand what's sensitive to them, you'll know exactly where to look
##### 
##### 61
##### 00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,640
##### for for high impact bugs.
##### 
##### 62
##### 00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,600
##### Second, their tech stock, what frameworks do they use?
##### 
##### 63
##### 00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,240
##### How do they handle authentication?
##### 
##### 64
##### 00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,840
##### What's the deployment process like?
##### 
##### 65
##### 00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,920
##### The deeper you go, the more likely you are to find bugs that others miss.
##### 
##### 66
##### 00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,200
##### And here's something that sets top hundreds apart.
##### 
##### 67
##### 00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,600
##### They don't just understand the current system.
##### 
##### 68
##### 00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,520
##### They follow every CVE and end date that comes out of their targets.
##### 
##### 69
##### 00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,120
##### Tech stock.
##### 
##### 70
##### 00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,120
##### When a new vulnerability drops in a framework your target uses, you should be
##### 
##### 71
##### 00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,320
##### the first one testing if they're affected.
##### 
##### 72
##### 00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,080
##### This is how you turn knowledge into real money.
##### 
##### 73
##### 00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,960
##### But don't just chase CVEs blindly, follow the right people, read the right
##### 
##### 74
##### 00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,160
##### content and when someone drops it right up about your target, don't just read
##### 
##### 75
##### 00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,960
##### it, understand it deeply.
##### 
##### 76
##### 00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,840
##### Ask yourself, what other futures might have the same issue.
##### 
##### 77
##### 00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,240
##### That's how you turn one bug into many.
##### 
##### 78
##### 00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,280
##### Now, before we dive into specific vulnerabilities, let's talk about picking your
##### 
##### 79
##### 00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,600
##### niche.
##### 
##### 80
##### 00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,160
##### This is where most bug hunters get it wrong.
##### 
##### 81
##### 00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,840
##### They try to learn everything at once and end up mastering nothing.
##### 
##### 82
##### 00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,720
##### Here's what works.
##### 
##### 83
##### 00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,880
##### Focus on web and mobile security.
##### 
##### 84
##### 00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
##### That's where the money is.
##### 
##### 85
##### 00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,840
##### And that's where most programs are.
##### 
##### 86
##### 00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,880
##### But don't just scatter your efforts across every platform, pick one major target
##### 
##### 87
##### 00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,560
##### and become the expert on that specific program.
##### 
##### 88
##### 00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,240
##### Think about it.
##### 
##### 89
##### 00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,480
##### Security is massive.
##### 
##### 90
##### 00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,600
##### We've got Web3 client side, server side, mobile desktop, but you don't need to
##### 
##### 91
##### 00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,640
##### master all of it.
##### 
##### 92
##### 00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,120
##### Pick one area and go deep.
##### 
##### 93
##### 00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,400
##### I mean, really deep.
##### 
##### 94
##### 00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,920
##### Learn the tech stack inside and out, understand their business model, build a
##### 
##### 95
##### 00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,480
##### collection of relevant bug reports, join this for communities that focus on
##### 
##### 96
##### 00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,120
##### your niche and follow the right researchers, reading other bug bounty hunters,
##### 
##### 97
##### 00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,720
##### the methodology and bug writeups is an optional.
##### 
##### 98
##### 00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,800
##### It's part of the job set time aside each week to study.
##### 
##### 99
##### 00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,200
##### Look at how other successful hunters approach your target.
##### 
##### 100
##### 00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,360
##### What techniques do they use?
##### 
##### 101
##### 00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,680
##### What patterns do you notice?
##### 
##### 102
##### 00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,200
##### This isn't about copying.
##### 
##### 103
##### 00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,840
##### It's just about building on what works.
##### 
##### 104
##### 00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,000
##### And don't get caught up trying to perfect your automation or tools.
##### 
##### 105
##### 00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,920
##### Learn just enough to be effective.
##### 
##### 106
##### 00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,840
##### Then spend time on actually hunting.
##### 
##### 107
##### 00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,200
##### The real progress happens when you're actively testing, not when you're
##### 
##### 108
##### 00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,600
##### tweaking your tools for the hundreds of time.
##### 
##### 109
##### 00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,600
##### Here's a strategy that actually works.
##### 
##### 110
##### 00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,040
##### Look for companies that run live.
##### 
##### 111
##### 00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,840
##### I can convince pick one become active on their program and make yourself
##### 
##### 112
##### 00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,080
##### known by building enough reputation.
##### 
##### 113
##### 00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,800
##### And you might even get invited to an exclusive event where the real money is.
##### 
##### 114
##### 00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,200
##### That's actually a tip that came from a treat from Douglas Day, AKA Archangel.
##### 
##### 115
##### 00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,720
##### I want to know, hey, how do you make 100 K and this was as
##### 
##### 116
##### 00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,360
##### responsive?
##### 
##### 117
##### 00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,080
##### I couldn't agree anymore.
##### 
##### 118
##### 00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,160
##### If you're still not ready and you need to master a specific vulnerability
##### 
##### 119
##### 00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,720
##### is before you decide on a niche, let me break down some vulnerability types
##### 
##### 120
##### 00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,800
##### that I personally think you should focus on that consistently lead to high
##### 
##### 121
##### 00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,680
##### impact finding.
##### 
##### 122
##### 00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,280
##### Let's start off with my favorite success, but not your basic alert
##### 
##### 123
##### 00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,040
##### success.
##### 
##### 124
##### 00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,280
##### I'm talking about chaining success with other functionalities or even
##### 
##### 125
##### 00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,200
##### open redirects to perform things like account takeovers.
##### 
##### 126
##### 00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,240
##### When you show a company how their accesses can lead to mass account compromise,
##### 
##### 127
##### 00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,360
##### then that's when those 10 K bounties start rolling in.
##### 
##### 128
##### 00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,200
##### But let me tell you something even better.
##### 
##### 129
##### 00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,800
##### Blind accesses, these are absolute gold because they often hit internal admin
##### 
##### 130
##### 00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,400
##### panels and support dashboards.
##### 
##### 131
##### 00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,600
##### Think about it when a support agent views a ticket or an admin reviews a profile,
##### 
##### 132
##### 00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,240
##### your payload executes with their privileges.
##### 
##### 133
##### 00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,640
##### I've seen blind accesses findings that pay more than most critical vulnerabilities
##### 
##### 134
##### 00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,680
##### because companies take internal compromise very seriously.
##### 
##### 135
##### 00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,320
##### So drop your accesses payload everywhere like a user profile for submissions,
##### 
##### 136
##### 00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,040
##### your user agent or even in error messages.
##### 
##### 137
##### 00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,160
##### The beautiful thing is that it might hit a few weeks or months later when someone
##### 
##### 138
##### 00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,360
##### internally finally reviews that data.
##### 
##### 139
##### 00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,920
##### And even if you get ahead, you're often looking at a security vulnerability
##### 
##### 140
##### 00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,480
##### that is going to give you access to internal systems.
##### 
##### 141
##### 00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,000
##### That's the kind of finding that can easily push you closer to that 100 K goal.
##### 
##### 142
##### 00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,720
##### That was an example of a client type vulnerability, but now we need to talk about a
##### 
##### 143
##### 00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,680
##### server cycle, not really like SSRF.
##### 
##### 144
##### 00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,080
##### SSRF is such a fun vulnerability, especially in cloud environments.
##### 
##### 145
##### 00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,600
##### Companies are pushing everything to AWS Azure and GCP.
##### 
##### 146
##### 00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,680
##### And when you can demonstrate how your SSRF can access internal services or
##### 
##### 147
##### 00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,440
##### a metadata endpoint, you are looking at a massive payday.
##### 
##### 148
##### 00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,520
##### But here's what most hunters don't think about.
##### 
##### 149
##### 00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,440
##### SSRF goes beyond just hitting the cloud metadata endpoints.
##### 
##### 150
##### 00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,560
##### Modern companies are running complex internal infrastructures.
##### 
##### 151
##### 00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,760
##### Think about your Kubernetes clusters, Kafka message cues internal APIs and even
##### 
##### 152
##### 00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,840
##### the monitoring systems.
##### 
##### 153
##### 00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,680
##### If you can pivot your SSRF to reach these services, then you're looking at a
##### 
##### 154
##### 00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,960
##### potential infrastructure while impact.
##### 
##### 155
##### 00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,800
##### These kinds of findings show real business impact because you're proving access
##### 
##### 156
##### 00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,240
##### to their entire backend infrastructure.
##### 
##### 157
##### 00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,400
##### The key here is to understand what modern companies are running internally.
##### 
##### 158
##### 00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,480
##### Learn about the common internal services, the default ports, the typical
##### 
##### 159
##### 00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,400
##### infrastructure setups.
##### 
##### 160
##### 00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,560
##### And when you find SSRF, don't stop at the first internal service that you
##### 
##### 161
##### 00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:44,840
##### hit.
##### 
##### 162
##### 00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,960
##### Think about what else might be accessible from there.
##### 
##### 163
##### 00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,280
##### Authorization issues are also where there is a ton of money to be made,
##### 
##### 164
##### 00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,200
##### especially for SaaS platforms.
##### 
##### 165
##### 00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,960
##### But here is what most hunters miss.
##### 
##### 166
##### 00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,600
##### Don't just look for basic items.
##### 
##### 167
##### 00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,480
##### Think bigger.
##### 
##### 168
##### 00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,800
##### Think about leaking sensitive information through the API endpoints.
##### 
##### 169
##### 00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,640
##### Can you access admin functionalities?
##### 
##### 170
##### 00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,280
##### Can you view other users data?
##### 
##### 171
##### 00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,360
##### That's what the companies are about.
##### 
##### 172
##### 00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,280
##### And that's what they care for.
##### 
##### 173
##### 00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,160
##### Here's a pro tip when you find these issues, always test them on off.
##### 
##### 174
##### 00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,680
##### By the night or within this, try it and see if we can access them without being
##### 
##### 175
##### 00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,160
##### logged in.
##### 
##### 176
##### 00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,120
##### If you find some admin functionality working for a regular user, then test
##### 
##### 177
##### 00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,680
##### out without being logged in and see if it can get access to it.
##### 
##### 178
##### 00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,200
##### Because testing for things like this, take a simple functionality from an
##### 
##### 179
##### 00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,880
##### admin that may not have an impact into a massive pative because you
##### 
##### 180
##### 00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,000
##### were able to prove multiple vulnerabilities within a single functionality.
##### 
##### 181
##### 00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,680
##### This actually leads me to one of the most overlooked aspects of bug hunting,
##### 
##### 182
##### 00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,720
##### which is proper API testing, but that comes with learning how to fuzz them properly.
##### 
##### 183
##### 00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,080
##### Most hunters just spray random parameters, but smart fuzzing is about
##### 
##### 184
##### 00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,960
##### understanding the API infrastructure and finding patterns.
##### 
##### 185
##### 00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,040
##### When you find one vulnerability, look for it across all of the API
##### 
##### 186
##### 00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,400
##### and points, one of my favorite things to actually look for is four or three
##### 
##### 187
##### 00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,320
##### bypasses and the patterns that come with it.
##### 
##### 188
##### 00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,440
##### Most people that see a four or three, they move on.
##### 
##### 189
##### 00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,160
##### But if you can bypass it and show how it leads to a massive data league, that
##### 
##### 190
##### 00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,520
##### is an easy critical finding.
##### 
##### 191
##### 00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,920
##### And then you can take that pattern and apply it across all of the different
##### 
##### 192
##### 00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,400
##### applications that the company owns.
##### 
##### 193
##### 00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,840
##### And don't sleep on patch reversals, especially when dealing with reverse
##### 
##### 194
##### 00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,880
##### proxies, modern applications are complex and the complexity creates one
##### 
##### 195
##### 00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,440
##### that abilities, one executed patch reversal can actually expose an entire
##### 
##### 196
##### 00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,000
##### internal network and tooling.
##### 
##### 197
##### 00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,880
##### So keep that in mind, even better, if you learn how to use patch
##### 
##### 198
##### 00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,120
##### reversals when it comes down to client side vulnerabilities, which is a whole
##### 
##### 199
##### 00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,840
##### different topic that I got to give a shout out to Justin, aka Ryan and
##### 
##### 200
##### 00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,640
##### writer and their podcast.
##### 
##### 201
##### 00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,000
##### Before we wrap up, I want to just talk about something that most people
##### 
##### 202
##### 00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,360
##### overlook on their journey to making their first 100,000.
##### 
##### 203
##### 00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360
##### And that's that every single dollar count.
##### 
##### 204
##### 00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,320
##### Listen, everyone dreams about landing that massive critical bug.
##### 
##### 205
##### 00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,760
##### The reality is that consistent medium findings can also add up and it helps
##### 
##### 206
##### 00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,640
##### build momentum.
##### 
##### 207
##### 00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,960
##### Don't get caught up and only hunting for criticals.
##### 
##### 208
##### 00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,680
##### If you can demonstrate real impact, reported those $500 and $1,000
##### 
##### 209
##### 00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,120
##### bounties, they stack up some of my most successful months come from multiple
##### 
##### 210
##### 00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,200
##### medium and high findings, rather than just one big hit.
##### 
##### 211
##### 00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,120
##### But here's the thing about reports.
##### 
##### 212
##### 00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,720
##### I love how Stoke explained this.
##### 
##### 213
##### 00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,680
##### They are your personal brand in debug bounty world.
##### 
##### 214
##### 00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,800
##### Think of each report as your shops window.
##### 
##### 215
##### 00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,280
##### You never know who's reading it or who they are connected to.
##### 
##### 216
##### 00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,000
##### I've seen hunters get private invites just because the reports were consistently
##### 
##### 217
##### 00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,720
##### professional and well run and learn to communicate impact clearly.
##### 
##### 218
##### 00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,360
##### Whatever you're using.
##### 
##### 219
##### 00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,960
##### See the assessor or not, make your point easy to understand.
##### 
##### 220
##### 00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,320
##### And if a charger doesn't accept the impact right away, don't get frustrated or
##### 
##### 221
##### 00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,200
##### just argue with them.
##### 
##### 222
##### 00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,680
##### Work on explaining it better.
##### 
##### 223
##### 00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,560
##### Sometimes a well explained medium bug can get escalated just because you
##### 
##### 224
##### 00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,360
##### communicated the impact clearly.
##### 
##### 225
##### 00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,760
##### And if a report gets undervalued and they get paid differently than
##### 
##### 226
##### 00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,600
##### you expected, don't let it get to you.
##### 
##### 227
##### 00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,480
##### State professional bug bounty is a long game.
##### 
##### 228
##### 00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,080
##### And your reputation is worth more than a single bounty.
##### 
##### 229
##### 00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,800
##### I have personally seen way too many bug bounty hunters burn bridges over a
##### 
##### 230
##### 00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,120
##### single downgraded report.
##### 
##### 231
##### 00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,160
##### And trust me, that's not how you get to $100,000.
##### 
##### 232
##### 00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:55,680
##### All right.
##### 
##### 233
##### 00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,280
##### What do you think?
##### 
##### 234
##### 00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,680
##### Are you ready to join the 100k club?
##### 
##### 235
##### 00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
##### Let me know down below.
##### 
##### 236
##### 00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,840
##### And I will see you all in next week's video.
##### 
##### 237
##### 00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,600
##### Peace.
